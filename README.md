# Vibe Check: Using Twitter’s API and Sentiment Analysis to Understand What’s the What on the Internet

> Workshop at STEM for HER Day - Dec 12 2022   
> *Speakers: Karnika Arora, Annabelle Gary*

APIs – Application Programming Interfaces – are ways that we as internet-users can access all sorts of data – the “mood” 
scores Spotify has for each song, the political donations people around the country make, information about every SpaceX 
rocket Elon Musk is launching soon. Come along with us as we use the Twitter API to grab tweets and apply sentiment 
analysis to them to understand what’s happening on the Internet these days.

This will be an interactive session where participants will be encouraged to participate by following along with our 
guided coding exercises and calling out ideas.
